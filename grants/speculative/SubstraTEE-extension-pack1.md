### Abstract

SCS has developed SubstraTEE with a grant from the web3 foundation. After fulfilling that grant with the delivery of M4, SCS continued the development on its own and has reached M5, adding a private token transfer implementation that allows to instantiate a paint-balances module within an enclave. SubstraTEE has drawn the attention of the Energy Web Foundation and other industry contacts looking for confidentiality solutions for substrate or Blockchains in general. Also, synergies with other grant teams like pLibra or Advanca have been identified.

On request of Parity Technologies and W3F, SCS proposes an extension to SubstraTEE that aims at approaching a production-ready MVP solution for enterprise use cases.

This extension pack will add:
  * accessing on-chain state within an enclave state transition function (STF)
  * verifying inclusion proofs for extrinsics
  * upstream alignment with parity substrate master (PR #3778)
  * security audit by external entity security hardening (including known issues)
  * (optional) a public testnet running a demo case
